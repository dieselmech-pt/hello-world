Just another repository
Hi fellow earthlings, newbie here looking at learning a bit of coding, long in the tooth so a challenge no doubt
Interested in mainly the hands on practical side of things, bought a soldering station so I could socket ECU's for tuning purposes
Also interesting in coding for map switch purposes in ECU's.
